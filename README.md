## Description

_This page is a collection on information about me. I hope that prospective employers glean a bit about myself from this project._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Open in a live server to view a local hosting of it_
* _easy-to-understand_

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this application depends on? We recommend deleting the project from your desktop, re-cloning the project from GitHub, and writing down all the steps necessary to get the project working again.}_

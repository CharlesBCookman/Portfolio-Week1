    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>As a thoughtful, open minded, fast learner, I have used these strengths to build a family with my wife Amber for over a decade. I am a father of two, a two year old and a five year old, and talk about them all the time. I have worked many jobs, from Computer Lab Monitor Supervisor, to General Manager at Dominos Pizza, and wasn't sure which career would be a good fit until I started coding.</p> 
    <p>As a lover of math, logic, language, and problem solving, the challenges of programming are the exact creative problem solving methods I have always enjoyed and excelled at. As a naturally collaborative person I am comfortable working in any kind of team. I also have years of leadership experience in my various roles and I can do well learning and working independently as well. I am a firm believer in leading with resect and understanding and can quickly earn the respect of peers with my work ethic.</p>

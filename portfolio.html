    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>As a thoughtful open minded fast learner, I have used these strengths to build a family with my wife Amber for over a decade. I am a father of two; my first, Zella, is five years old and Gavin is my two year old. I have worked all kinds of jobs from Computer Lab Monitor Supervisor to General Manager at Dominos Pizza, and wasn't sure which carrer would be a good fit until I started coding.</p> 
    <p>As a lover of math, logic, language, and problem solving the challenges of programing are the exact creative problem solving methods I have always loved and excelled at. As a naturally collaborative person I am comfortable working in any kind of team. I also have years of leardership experience in my various roles and I can do well learning and working independently as well. I am a firm believer in leading with repect and understanding and can quickly earn the respect of peers with my work ethic.</p>
